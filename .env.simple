# --- MODEL CONFIGURATION ---
# This is now primarily handled in config/settings.py's MODELS list.
# If you were to use MODELS_CONFIG environment variable, it would look like:
MODELS_CONFIG='[{"model_id": "gemma-3-4b", "model_path": "/app/models/gemma-3-4b-it-q4_0.gguf", "n_gpu_layers": -1, "is_multimodal": true}]'
# But since you're editing settings.py directly for the MODELS list, you might not need MODELS_CONFIG in .env.
